# Django Movie Ratings Part 2

## Description

Create an interface in Django to the [MovieLens dataset][movielens].

## Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Create regular expressions to map URLs to views
* Explain what a view is
* Explain what a template is
* Design simple views
* Use basic HTML
* Extrapolate from basic HTML how to create templates

## Details

### Requirements
* 404 Errors on bad data
* Tests
* No pep8 errors

### Deliverables

* A Git repo called django-movies containing at least:
  * a `requirements.txt` file
  * a `README.md` file
  * a Django project called `movieratings`

### Normal Mode
You may use your django application from [last week](https://github.com/tiy-lv-python-2015-10/django-movies)
 or create a new one.  You need to add enough data to 
accomplish the following in views and templates.  If you would like to try to
avoid so much manual data input please attempt hard mode to get the full data 
set loaded for you.

* The top 20 movies rated. This list of movies should have their average rating,
  and each movie listed should have a link to its individual page.

* Each individual movie. This page should have the movie, its average rating,
  and each person who rated it. The list of people should have the rating
  with each person and should have a link to that person's page.

* Each individual user. This page should have their demographic data, and a
  list of all movies they've rated, with the rating they gave it. Each movie
  listed should have the rating they gave it beside it and should have a link
  to that movie's page.

### Hard Mode

Migrate the system over to your local postgres database.  This will be similar
 to what needs to happen with a new production database.  You can find the information on this
[here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/settings/#std:setting-DATABASES).  The second code example shows
the configuration for postgres.  You will need to create the database like last week
then run migrations on it. 

Take [the script I wrote to turn MovieLens 1M data into fixtures](https://github.com/tiy-lv-python-2015-10/django-movies-part-2/blob/master/convert_ml_1m_data.py)
and modify it to turn your CSV data into fixtures, then load those fixtures
with `python manage.py loaddata <fixture_file>`.
